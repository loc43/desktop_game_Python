#Download the Game from the dinodev Branch

The Game is a modified version of the Google Chrome Dino (T-Rex) game.
---

Core Gameplay:
---
Jump over cacti with a single press of the spacebar.

Avoid pterodactyls: jump over some or duck under others by holding the down arrow key.

The game progressively accelerates.

A running score counter tracks your progress.

Rules:
---
Colliding with a cactus or pterodactyl causes the dinosaur to die, unless a power-up is active.

Play multiple rounds and try to beat your personal Best Score.

Power-up — Temporary Invincibility:
---
--- "The Hat of Immortality" — grants complete invulnerability for 5 seconds upon collision. This effect has a fixed duration, unaffected by the game's acceleration.
